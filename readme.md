## The accelerated DP marginal sampler

We use iris data set as our example. Iris data contains 150 observations coming from three subclasses each of 50. For simplicity, we use the 2nd and the 3rd dimension of the data set. 

In our sampler, we first set all the flowers in the first class, and try to show how our sampler cluster this data set.
